## How to use
The first sections of the CV are click to edit. When hovered over, these sections will display a light gray background. The sections for education and work experience have an add button which when clicked will reveal a multi input form. 

## What I learned
This was my first project using React. Since most of the coding involved just displaying information from forms I decided to try to incorporate MUI components in order to learn how to use them. 
1. MUI - as the project went on I became more comfortable with incorporating MUI components. I began to see the use of using their components since I wouldn't have to constantly restyle components. Although I didn't use their theme generator, next time I will definitely try it out. 
2. One handleChange() for multiple inputs. This was something I had to search up. I considered using multiple functions (one for each input) but it seemed cluncky.
3. setState() for nested states. You have to use the ... operator to keep all other states the same except the one you want to change.

## Built with
* js, react, MUI html, css
